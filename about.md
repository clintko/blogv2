- [Data Analysis](https://clintko.github.io/BlogDataAnalysis/)

I have learned piano since I was small. Playing music help me to relieve pressure. I start to learn violin when I was senior in university. I have joined in a student orchestra and we performed together annually. Besides violin, I love to make cocktail. It is interesting to explore the mixology and share my work with my friends. I often hold small cocktail parties and invite lab members to my home.
