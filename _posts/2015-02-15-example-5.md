It is really hot today. When having supper, I made my own cocktail and called
it "Blue Fairy Cooler".

I first shacked the ice with one fresh mint leaf in the shaker to
create crushed ice.

Then, I mixed the ingredient together. Below is the recipe.

| Wine          | brand         | Proportion  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----------:|
| Gin           | Tanqueray 10  |      1      |
| Curacao Blue  | Marie Brizard |      2      |
| Peach Liquor  | Marie Brizard |      1      |
| Tonic Water   | Schweppes     |             |

Finally, add some fresh Mint leaves for dressing.
