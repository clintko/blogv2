title: My First Post
---

This is my first post here. I construct the blog using Jekyll and Github follow by the tutorial in Youtube channel: [WebJeda](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm_Qt4aKpfKijgP0rDH7FSJOlS9IBGbT1) and [Thomas Bradley](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWjCJDeWfDdfVEcLGAfdJn_HXyM4Y7_k-). Both contains many great videos about constructing a blog using Jekyll and Github. I would recommend to anyone who wants to give it a try.

Normally, I write notes, my ideas, information, dairy or anything in evernote. One day I feel it might be fun to share those to others. Therefore, I start to find tools for writing blog.

At first, I wrote blog in wordpress.com; however, it is not easy to customize the website to the style I want. Using Jekyll, it is much easier to write posts using markdown. Although many functions and ways of customization requires some technical knowledge, it is still worth to spend time on it.

If everything goes well, I will keep moving some of my notes to GitHub and start to write blogs here.
